### **Chapter 2 - On the Job with a Network Manager**

#### **1. Who is a Network Manager?**
- Network managers encompass various roles with different titles such as network operators, administrators, planners, craft technicians, and help desk representatives. The term "network manager" itself is rarely used but represents the individuals managing network operations and infrastructure.

#### **2. Providers of Network Management**
- Key players include application providers, equipment vendors, and systems integrators who collectively contribute to the setup, functioning, and optimization of networks.

#### **3. A Day in the Life of a Network Manager**
- The daily tasks and responsibilities depend heavily on the type of organization (e.g., global or local) and their capability to provide large-scale, highly available services. Network availability is often held to the "five nines" standard (99.999% uptime).
- **Network Operators**: Focus on network statistics, user delays, service levels, and reported issues across geographical areas.
- **Trouble Tickets and Alarm Messages**: Key responsibilities include handling and diagnosing issues through trouble tickets and system alarms, providing tiered support, and ensuring problem resolution.

#### **4. Role Scenarios in Network Management**
- **Global Service Providers**: Network operators must manage detailed utilization statistics, diagnose root causes of issues, and resolve service-affecting alarms.
- **Medium-Size Network Administrators**: Often work for organizations with branch locations interconnected by Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) managed by Managed Service Providers (MSPs). Tasks include monitoring network health and addressing issues through status views and health displays.
- **Internet Data Center Administrators**: These individuals manage complex data center networks involving intranet, extranet, and public web services. Tasks involve setting up VLANs for segregating traffic and ensuring security.

#### **5. Tools and Technology Used by Network Managers**
- **Craft Terminals**: User-friendly interfaces for interacting with individual network equipment.
- **Network Analyzers**: Tools like packet sniffers and traffic analyzers that monitor and interpret network packet flows.
- **Collectors and Probes**: Devices that collect and store network data (e.g., NetFlow collectors) and actively trigger network activities to gather data responses.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Tools for identifying and responding to suspicious network patterns and potential attacks.
- **Alarm Management Systems**: Systems to collect and monitor network-generated alarms, ensuring timely responses.

#### **6. Workflow and Management Systems**
- **Workflow Management Systems**: Include inventory systems, service provisioning tools, service order-management, and billing systems, which streamline network operations and task management.

#### **7. Observations from Different Roles**
- Pat, Chris, and Sandy represent varied roles in network management, from specialized task groups to comprehensive network planners. Integration between tools significantly affects operator productivity and efficiency, with tasks varying from manual to automated processes.

#### **8. Challenges and Operational Considerations**
- Tasks in network management often involve complex interactions among many functions. Integration of tools, adherence to operational guidelines, and high-level abstraction in management are vital for productivity and network stability.

#### **9. Summary**
- The chapter concludes by highlighting the broad infrastructure required for service provider environments and the diverse tasks characterizing medium-sized enterprises.
