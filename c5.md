# Chapter 5 - Network Management Architecture (Farrel Book)

---

### Key Topics Covered:
1. **Background and Definition of Network Management (NM)**  
   - NM comprises the functions to control, plan, allocate, deploy, coordinate, and monitor network resources.
   - Previously treated as an afterthought, NM is now critical for network operation and efficiency.

2. **Network Management Functions and Hierarchy**:
   - **Business Management**: Focuses on budget, planning, and agreements.
   - **Service Management**: Manages service delivery aspects, including bandwidth, storage, and application services.
   - **Network Management**: Comprehensive management of network devices.
   - **Element Management**: Focuses on specific types or collections of network devices.
   - **Networkâ€“Element Management**: Pertains to individual devices, such as routers and switches.

3. **Network Management Mechanisms**:  
   - **Protocols Used**: SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), CMIP (Common Management Information Protocol), and CMOT (CMIP over TCP/IP).

4. **Monitoring Mechanisms**:
   - Data collection methods include polling and monitoring of network elements using protocols like SNMP.
   - Data is stored in **Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary storage** locations for processing and archival purposes.

5. **Monitoring for Event Notification**:
   - Example scenario illustrating data load: A network with 100 devices, each with 4 interfaces monitored for 8 characteristics, results in high data traffic and storage needs.
   - Strategies for managing traffic spikes during polling intervals.

6. **Instrumentation Mechanisms**:
   - Tools and utilities to monitor and probe the network for data.
   - Mechanisms include SNMP access, direct access, and various monitoring tools.

7. **Configuration Mechanisms**:
   - **Direct Access**: Using Telnet, CLI, HTTP, CORBA.
   - **Remote Access**: Involves SNMP-based commands, FTP/TFTP for file downloads.

8. **FCAPS Model of Network Management**:
   - **Fault Management**: Identifying and resolving network issues.
   - **Configuration Management**: System setup and provisioning.
   - **Accounting Management**: Monitoring and billing for network services.
   - **Performance Management**: Data collection and analysis for performance control.
   - **Security Management**: Implementing security protocols and data analysis.

9. **Network Management Process and Models**:
   - **In-band vs Out-of-band Management**: Defines communication paths for network management data.
   - **Centralized, Distributed, and Hierarchical Management**:
     - Centralized: Single management system control.
     - Distributed: Multiple components spread across the system.
     - Hierarchical: Separation of functions like monitoring, storage, and processing across devices.

10. **Scaling Network Management Traffic**:
    - Factors include device numbers, polling frequency, and data parameters.
    - Recommendations for WAN and LAN monitoring and traffic handling.

11. **Managing Network Management Data**:
    - Strategies for collecting, storing, and analyzing management data.
    - Data migration and selective data storage techniques.

12. **Integration with OSS (Operation Support Systems)**:
    - Network management integrates with OSS components for ordering, provisioning, activation, and field services, utilizing protocols like SNMP and CORBA.

### Detailed Notes:

1. **Network Management Overview**  
   - NM encompasses planning, allocation, and control of resources across networks. Modern architectures make NM a core part of their operations due to its necessity for service reliability and efficiency.

2. **Hierarchy of Management**:
   - **Business Management** deals with overall budget and strategy.
   - **Service Management** focuses on quality delivery and resources.
   - **Network and Element Management** oversee device-level and network-wide elements respectively.

3. **Mechanisms and Protocols**:
   - SNMP is a key protocol for gathering network management data. CMIP offers more complex management but is less commonly used due to its complexity.

4. **Event Monitoring and Data Collection**:
   - Polling and monitoring mechanisms are designed to ensure device health and network performance. High data volume from monitoring necessitates efficient data handling and storage solutions.

5. **Configuration and Instrumentation**:
   - Configuration methods range from direct device access (via CLI) to remote access using management protocols and file transfers. Instrumentation focuses on data access, collection, and integration with monitoring tools.

6. **FCAPS Model**:
   - Provides a structured approach to managing different aspects of network operations, from fault detection to billing.

7. **Network Models**:
   - Centralized, distributed, and hierarchical approaches offer flexibility in managing large-scale and complex networks.

8. **Data Management and OSS Integration**:
   - Data collection, storage, and integration with OSS systems ensure end-to-end network management and service support. Selective data migration and traffic scaling ensure optimal performance across different network environments.
