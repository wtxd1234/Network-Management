### **Chapter 2.1 - Review of Information Network and Technology**

#### **1. Objectives**
- Overview of network components and technologies to be managed.
- Exploration of network topologies (LAN and WAN), including wired and wireless configurations.
- Examination of transmission technologies, Ethernet standards, and advanced networking components such as routers, bridges, and switches.

#### **2. Network Components and Topologies**
- **Components**: Networks consist of links, nodes, bridges, routers, gateways, switches, and transmission media.
- **LAN Topologies**:
  - **Bus Topology**: Uses a shared medium with CSMA/CD for access control. It offers easy implementation but suffers from low utilization under heavy traffic.
  - **Ring Topology**: Employed in token-ring and FDDI networks, offering deterministic access and high utilization.
  - **Star Topology**: Central hub-based LAN, often combined with bus or ring configurations.
  - **Hybrid Topology**: Integrates multiple basic topologies.
- **Wireless LANs**: Hierarchical and ad-hoc configurations based on IEEE 802.11 standards, addressing data rates, security, and multivendor interoperability.

#### **3. Network Types**
- **WAN Topologies**:
  - **Mesh Topology**: Provides redundancy, load balancing, and shortest path routing at the network layer.
  - **Tree Topology**: Utilized with Ethernet bridges, ideal for small and special-purpose networks.
- **Fiber Networks**: Gigabit LANs and Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) utilize high-speed fiber connections for scalable network infrastructure.

#### **4. Ethernet LAN Standards and Protocols**
- **Ethernet LANs**: Governed by IEEE 802.3 standards, supporting data rates of 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps and above. It employs CSMA/CD for collision management, with constraints on packet size and segment length.
  - **Fast Ethernet**: 100 Mbps standard with compatibility for 10Base-T networks, using CAT5e and CAT6 cabling for extended reach.
  - **Gigabit Ethernet**: Provides higher throughput with features like packet bursts, and supports diverse media such as single-mode and multimode fibers.

#### **5. Advanced Networking Concepts**
- **Switched Ethernet**: Enhances throughput and management capabilities, often used in client-server configurations with virtual LANs (VLANs).
- **Token Ring and FDDI**: High-reliability networking technologies utilizing dual-ring topologies and modified token-ring protocols.
- **Network Nodes and Components**: Include hubs, bridges, routers, gateways, and switches that facilitate data transmission, routing, and conversion across network protocols.

#### **6. Routers and Gateways**
- **Routers**: Operate at the network layer, managing packet flow and routing using network protocols.
- **Gateways**: Facilitate communication between networks with differing protocols, performing necessary conversions at the network or application layers.
- **Tunneling**: Encapsulation of packets for secure transmission across incompatible networks, often employed in mobile environments.

#### **7. Transmission Technologies**
- **Transmission Media**: Encompasses wired (UTP, coaxial, fiber) and wireless (terrestrial and satellite) mediums.
- **Multiplexing**: Techniques like TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) and WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) allow efficient data transport over shared channels.
- **SONET/SDH**: Synchronous optical networks provide high-speed, fiber-based communication, supporting large bandwidths.

#### **8. Broadband Networks and Services**
- Integrates services for voice, video, and data through technologies like ISDN, ADSL, and fixed/mobile wireless networks, often utilizing ATM and SONET/SDH standards.

#### **9. Miscellaneous Technologies**
- **Switched Networks**: Circuit-switched and packet-switched networks, crucial for WAN communications.
- **MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)**: Combines IP's versatility with ATM's performance, enhancing network efficiency.
- **DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing)**: Expands fiber capacity by multiplexing different wavelengths for transmission.
