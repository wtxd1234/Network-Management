### **Chapter 3.1 - Basic Foundations: Standards, Models, and Language**

#### **1. Objectives**
- Understanding the essential standards, models, and language required for network management.
- Overview of network management models including OSI, Internet, TMN, IEEE 802, and Web-based management.
- Key communication protocols (e.g., SNMP, CMIP) and languages (e.g., ASN.1) used for managing network systems.

#### **2. Standards and Models**
- **Standards**: Govern network management and ensure interoperability and consistent communication.
  - **OSI/CMIP**: Comprehensive international standard focusing on LAN/WAN management, encompassing all 7 layers of the OSI model with an object-oriented approach but requiring high implementation resources.
  - **SNMP/Internet**: Widely used industry standard, initially designed for internet management but also applicable to WANs and telecommunications.
  - **TMN**: Focuses on telecommunication networks, adhering to the OSI framework, addressing both network and business-level management.
  - **IEEE**: Primarily targets LAN and MAN management, incorporating OSI standards and focusing on the first two OSI layers.
  - **Web-Based Management**: Includes approaches like WBEM (Web-Based Enterprise Management), JMX (Java Management Extension), XML-based management, and CORBA.

#### **3. OSI Architecture and Model**
- **Organization**: Encompasses network management components, their functions, relationships, and management information structure (SMI).
- **Functions**: Include configuring, monitoring, measuring performance, securing information, and usage accounting.
- **Communication**: Utilizes bidirectional messages and transfer structures (PDU - Protocol Data Unit).

#### **4. SNMP Architecture**
- Similar to the OSI model but simpler with unidirectional messaging.
- Focuses on management functions like fault, configuration, performance, security, and accounting.

#### **5. TMN Architecture**
- Built on the OSI model, it addresses the management of telecommunication networks, including network, service, and business-level management.

#### **6. Network Management Models**
- **Organizational Model**: Defines managers (which send requests and monitor alarms) and agents (which gather and respond to information from managed objects).
- **Two-Tier Model**: Agents are embedded in network elements, such as managed hubs or routers.
- **Three-Tier Model**: Introduces an intermediate layer that acts as both a manager to lower-tier elements and an agent to higher-tier systems.
- **Manager of Managers (MoM)**: Provides an integrated view of multiple domains, managed geographically, administratively, or by vendor-specific products.
- **Peer NMSs**: Network management systems can function as peers, sharing management roles.

#### **7. Management Information and MIBs**
- The Management Information Base (MIB) is a virtual data store containing the information that management applications need about a device. It defines the relationship and operations on objects in a network.
- **Example**: A MIB view is analogous to a library system catalog that provides views and operations on available information.

#### **8. Structure of Management Information (SMI)**
- Defines syntax, semantics, status, and access to managed objects.
- MIB access and views depend on what a management agent perceives and allows.

#### **9. Data Structures and ASN.1**
- **ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)**: A language for defining data types and structures independent of lower-layer protocols. It supports abstract and transfer syntax and can generate machine-readable code using Basic Encoding Rules (BER).
- **Data Types and Constructs**: Examples include sequences, sets, choices, and enumerations.

#### **10. Communication Protocols and Functions**
- **SNMP (Internet)** and **CMIP (OSI)** provide protocols for managing network systems, with variations in their approaches to communication, notifications, and operations.
- **Transfer Protocols**: Include features like connection-oriented and connectionless communication.

#### **11. Functional Model for Network Management**
- **Configuration Management**: Setting and changing network parameters and alarm thresholds.
- **Fault Management**: Detection and resolution of network failures.
- **Performance Management**: Monitoring and optimizing network performance.
- **Security Management**: Encompasses authentication, authorization, encryption, and more.
- **Accounting Management**: Tracks and analyzes network usage.
