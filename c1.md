### **Chapter 1 Overview - NET3207 Network Management**

#### **1. Introduction to Network Management**
- **Definition**: Network management encompasses the activities, methods, tools, and procedures that pertain to operating, administering, maintaining, and provisioning networked systems.
- Examples are drawn from contexts such as healthcare and event management, likening network management to organizing complex activities with multiple dependencies.

#### **2. Core Concepts of Network Management**
- **Operations**: Refers to the day-to-day tasks required to ensure network functionality and uptime.
- **Administration**: Encompasses tasks like network configuration, user management, and resource allocation.
- **Maintenance**: Involves activities that ensure network stability, such as updates, troubleshooting, and preventive maintenance.
- **Provisioning**: The process of setting up network resources and services for new users or modifying configurations for existing users.

#### **3. Scope of Network Management**
- Network management can be broadly defined to encompass "networked systems," or more narrowly focused on "communication networks."
- The critical factors in network management include minimizing operational costs, maximizing service quality, and ensuring a rapid rollout of new services.

#### **4. Network Equipment Costs**
- Balancing cost efficiency and maintaining high service quality is vital.
- Emphasis on factors like reliability, availability, and quality of service (QoS) that directly impact network performance and customer satisfaction.

#### **5. Revenue Implications**
- Network management is not solely about reducing costs but also enabling revenue streams by automating workflows, enhancing service features, and providing responsive capabilities like online service configuration.

#### **6. Key Stakeholders in Network Management**
- **Service Providers**: Different types offer network-related services.
- **Enterprise IT Departments**: Focused on internal operational stability.
- **Equipment Vendors and System Integrators**: Supply and integrate network management solutions tailored to specific operational needs.

#### **7. Application Characteristics**
- Management systems must be tailored for various purposes like transaction-based systems, interrupt-driven systems, and number-crunching tasks.
- Analyzing trends, evaluating resource utilization, and identifying bottlenecks are critical for network optimization and future planning.

#### **8. Scalability and Distribution**
- Scalability considerations focus on building robust systems that handle large-scale networks efficiently.
- Features such as operations concurrency, event propagation, distributed processing, and efficient addressing are essential for scalability and smooth operation.

#### **9. Cross-Section of Network Management Technologies**
- **Information Modelling**: Establishing relationships between network devices, services, and users.
- **Databases**: For persistent data storage and access.
- **Communication Protocols**: To ensure effective network management communication.
- **User Interfaces and System Distribution**: Critical during the design stage for effective interaction and failover capabilities.

#### **10. Integration and Organizational Challenges**
- Network management often involves the integration of various applications for seamless service monitoring and provisioning.
- Challenges include geographical distribution of tasks, operational procedures, and contingency planning for unexpected events.

#### **11. Business Challenges**
- Cost valuation of network management and the balance between network management features versus standalone products are critical factors affecting market success.

#### **12. Chapter Summary**
- Network management is fundamentally about managing, monitoring, and optimizing network functions through a systematic approach involving operation, administration, maintenance, and provisioning.
